  <summary>Introduction </summary>
      Suicide is death caused by injuring oneself with the intent to die. A suicide attempt is when someone harms themselves with any intent to end their       life,but they do not die as a result of their actions.<sup>1</sup>
      Suicide affects all ages. In 2020,in the United States suicide was among the top 9 leading causes of death for people ages 10-64. Suicide was the         second leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and 25-34.<sup>2</sup>
      Suicide and suicide attempts cause serious emotional, physical, and economic impacts. People who attempt suicide and survive may experience serious       injuries that can have long-term effects on their health. They may also experience depression and other mental health concerns.<sup>3</sup>
      Suicide and suicide attempts affect the health and well-being of friends, loved ones, co-workers, and the community. When people die by suicide,         their surviving family and friends may experience shock, anger, guilt, symptoms of depression or anxiety, and may even experience thoughts of             suicide themselves.<sup>3</sup>
      The good news is that more than 90% of people who attempt suicide and survive never go on to die by suicide.<sup>4</sup>
